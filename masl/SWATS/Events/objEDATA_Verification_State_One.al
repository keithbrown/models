# Test 1 - Reception of multiple events
#
#          N.B.
#          This test has had to be changed due to a quirk with in the KC 
#          tool KC cannot cope with a parameter having the same name as 
#          that of a key letter of a domain or project. Becuase of this 
#          when a new project was created with a key letter of D the 
#          parameter D would no longer be accepted. However on removeing 
#          the project, remenence of the project still remain and so D 
#          would still not be accepted.
#          For this reason D has been renamed to E and E is now F. 
#          Unfortunatly this means that until the project with the key 
#          letter of D is fully removed frozen versions of the WACA will 
#          no longer work.
